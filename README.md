# Arabic_RAG


## Overview

This repository contains a system for processing user queries and generating responses based on contextual analysis of the PDF content. The system utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) and vector embedding techniques provided by OpenAI to enhance search and retrieval functionalities.

## Functionality

1. **Data Ingestion**: PDF data provided by clients is ingested into the Qdrant Vector Database for efficient storage and retrieval.
2. **Embedding Data**: Upon startup, the application loads pre-existing vector embeddings of PDF data using the OpenAI embedding model, facilitating quick access during search operations.
3. **User Query**: Users can submit queries through the frontend interface, initiating the search process.
4. **Embedding Query**: The OpenAI embedding model processes the user's query text, generating an embedding representation to capture semantic similarities.
5. **Search in Vector Database**: Embedded queries are compared with chunks of text stored in the vector database using cosine similarity, identifying relevant matches.
6. **Retrieve Chunks**: Text chunks with high cosine similarity scores to the query are retrieved from the vector database, forming the basis for further analysis.
7. **Prompt Generation**: Retrieved text chunks and the original query are passed to the OpenAI language model (GPT-4) to generate a contextual prompt, providing additional context for answer generation.
8. **Answer Generation**: The contextual prompt and retrieved text chunks serve as input to the GPT-4 model, which generates a response based on the provided context and query.
9. **Return Response**: The generated answer is sent back to the frontend for display to the user, completing the query-response cycle.

## Setup Steps

```bash
# Create a python virtual environment and activate it
python3 -m virtualenv rag
source rag/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your environment variables in the .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY='provide_your_key'" >> .env
echo "QDRANT_API_KEY='provide_your_key'" >> .env
echo "QDRANT_URI='provide_your_uri'" >> .env
```

## To Run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Known Limitations

This is a basic application with limitations in complexity and multimodal capabilities.

## Pipeline Enhancement Opportunities

- **Multimodal Parsing**: Upgrade the current PyMuPDF-based PDF parsing with a more sophisticated parser for improved extraction of images and tables. Employ a high-quality Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) to enhance image descriptions and implement structured data analysis techniques like text2sql or text2pandas for efficient table summarization.
- **Evaluation Complexity**: Evaluating multimodal RAG pipelines is intricate due to the independence of each modality (text, images, tables). For complex queries requiring information synthesis across modalities, refining response quality becomes a challenging task. Aim for a comprehensive evaluation approach that captures the intricacies of multimodal interactions.
- **Guardrails Implementation**: Implementing robust guardrails for multimodal systems presents unique challenges.
